******************************************************************
The Problem
******************************************************************

Current Executor proposal does not define a specific concrete context.
An Execution Context is meant to mediate between Execution agents,
an executor, and execution resources.
Specifically, an execution context is responsible for
managing the execution of a number of (light-weight) execution agents
on an execution resource.
An execution context also provides executors for submitting work to itself.

The Executor proposal currently does not specifically define a
concrete execution context, other then providing a static thread pool
as a basic example.
As the executor proposal is a joint proposal between several
industry representatives - parallel and vectorized algorithms,
multi-threaded execution, heterogeneous and distributed execution,
and network execution.
It was not deemed necessary to provide a specific concrete execution context.
For some areas, a concrete execution context is necessary because
it could be used to manage a stream or queue of command kernels,
such as in heterogeneous or distributed computing.
In other domains, such as parallel aand vectorized algorithms,
it may remain an abstract concept. 


This paper focuses on those domains where a concrete Execution Context
is extremely important while also proposing a mechanism for defining
the system affinity.

Another area of interest that can be supported by Context
is the querying of the memory affinity status of the system.
This is important as a concept to enable future support for
affinity (see the Affinity paper). This is an area that
requires a solution and this papers outlines one such direction.


******************************************************************
Proposal
******************************************************************

Add this minimal ExecutionContext specification to the Executors TS.

-----------------------------------------------------
Concept / Definition
-----------------------------------------------------

A concurrency and parallelism **execution context** manages a set of 
execution agents on a set of **execution resources** of a given
**execution architecture**.
These execution agents execute work, implemented by a callable,
that is submitted to the execution context by an **executor**.
One or more types of executors may submit work to the same
execution context.
Work submitted to an execution context is **incomplete** until
(1) it is invoked and exits execution by return or exception or 
(2) its submission for execution is canceled.

    Note: The *execution context* terminology used here
    and in the Networking TS (N4656) deviate from the 
    traditional *context of execution* usage that refers
    to the state of a single executing callable; *e.g.*,
    program counter, registers, stack frame.

-----------------------------------------------------
Contrast to Networking TS (N4656) Execution Context
-----------------------------------------------------

The Networking TS (N4656 / 2017-03-17) defines a
*networking execution context* as

  "Class ``execution_context`` implements an extensible, type-safe,
  polymorphic set of services, indexed by service type."

The networking TS requirements for ``execution_context``
specify a single ``execution_context::executor_type``.
This executor type has numerous work submission member functions
each with particular semantics.


Differences between our proposed parallelism and concurrency execution context
and the networking execution context include the following.

  #.  Networking context is limited to executing work, as opposed to providing unspecified services.

  #.  Networking context is not a concrete base class from which other forms of execution contexts
      are derived; *e.g.*, ``system_context`` , ``io_context`` .

  #.  Our context is an extensible one-to-many relationship between an execution context type
      and executor types that may submit work, as opposed to a particular
      executor type with specific work submission functions.

  #.  Our proposed ``async_execution_context`` could be viewed as having
      similar intent as the networking ``system_context``.
      The significant difference is interchangeability with
      ``std::async`` usage and extensibility to other executors
      versus the prescribed networking ``system_executor``.


-----------------------------------------------------
Partitioning and Affinity State of the Art
-----------------------------------------------------

Hardware Locality (hwloc) Software Package
------------------------------------------

The `hardware locality (hwloc) software package
<https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/>`_
provides a portable interface for querying and managing
hardware resources, including *processing units*
on which threads execute.
The proposed thread execution resource is motivated
by a small fraction of hwloc capabilities.

SYCL for OpenCL and HSA
-----------------------

`SYCL <https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/specs/sycl-1.2.pdf>`_ (based on
`OpenCL <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/opencl-2.2.pdf>`_)
provides a C++ programming model for targeting a wide range of heterogeneous
systems including multi-core CPUs, NUMA systems, embedded SoCs and discrete
accelerators.
`HSA (Heterogeneous System Architecture) <http://www.hsafoundation.com/standards/>`_
is a similar standard that provides a lower level, and lower overhead API and
set of architecture requirements.

Both of these standards represent the topology of a system with a hierarchy of
ids that remain constant throughout the execution of a program. Both also allow
users to partition the system topology to do fine-grained work execution. The
extent of the partitioning depends on the platform.

OpenMP
------

In contrast, OpenMP requires an external environment variable set by the user.
They use the idea of an abstract Place as defined by the user over all threads, cores, and sockets.
In this way, it enable the user to secify the granularity of the topology, and then further enable
defining the desired affinity for being on the same Place as master thread, or scatter out in a round robin fashion, 
as well as compacting it around the Master. It can also define for each nested parallelism level,
because the work may change or become irregular during runtime. 

This design, while flexible is not possible for C++ Affinity. C++ cannot use the environment variable for input configuration.
The advantage of the OpenMP design is its use of abstract places which makes it flexible for some future core configuration
but it means the programmer has to decide whether to describe the places 
in terms of threads, cores, or sockets which still requires some actual hardware knowledge. 
Still, the fundamental of its implementation has shown it is doable on most architectures. In that respect, C++ implementation
would only need to define the interface, but the underlying mechanism should be similar.
Since its addition in OpenMP 3, this feature has a great deal of experience from HPC and demonstartes implementability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minimal *Concept* Specification
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The proposed *parallelism and concurrency execution context*
  has minimal scope, with the intent to grow this scope as
  consensus is achieved on `potential additions`_.

.. code-block:: c++

  class ExecutionContext /* exposition only */ {
  public:

    template <typename ExecutionContextProperty>
      /* exposition only */ detail::query_t< ExecutionContext , ExecutionContextProperty >
    query(ExecutionContextProperty p) const ;

    ~ExecutionContext();

    // Not copyable or moveable
    ExecutionContext( ExecutionContext const & ) = delete ;
    ExecutionContext( ExecutionContext && ) = delete ;
    ExecutionContext & operator = ( ExecutionContext const & ) = delete ;
    ExecutionContext & operator = ( ExecutionContext && ) = delete ;

    // Execution resource
    using execution_resource_t = /* implementation defined */ ;

    execution_resource_t const & execution_resource() const noexcept ;

    // Executor generator
    template< class ... ExecutorProperties >
      /* exposition only */ detail::executor_t< ExecutionContext , ExecutorProperties... >
    executor( ExecutorProperties... );

    // Waiting functions:
    void wait();
    template< class Clock , class Duration >
    bool wait_until( chrono::time_point<Clock,Duration> const & );
    template< class Rep , class Period >
    bool wait_for( chrono::duration<Rep,Period> const & );
  };

  bool operator == ( ExecutionContext const & , ExecutionContext const & );
  bool operator != ( ExecutionContext const & , ExecutionContext const & );

  // Execution context properties:

  constexpr struct reject_on_destruction_t {} reject_on_destruction;
  constexpr struct abandon_on_destruction_t {} abandon_on_destruction;
  constexpr struct abort_on_destruction_t {} abort_on_destruction;
  constexpr struct wait_on_destruction_t {} wait_on_destruction;

..

Let ``EC`` be an *ExecutionContext* type.


| ``template <typename ExecutionContextProperty>``
|    ``/* exposition only */ detail::query_t< EC , ExecutionContextProperty >``
| ``EC::query(ExecutionContextProperty p) const noexcept;``

  Requires:
  ``ExecutionContextProperty`` is an execution context property.

  Returns:
  The current value of the execution context property specified by ``p``
  when the execution context supports the input property.
  Otherwise ``void``.
  [Note: The *detail::query_t* is for exposition only denoting the
  expectation that an implementation will use an implementation-defined
  metafunction to determine the return type. --end note]

  Remark:
  When ``is_same_v<void,decltype(ec.query(p))`` then the execution context
  property is unknown to the execution context.


``EC::execution_resource_t const & EC::execution_resource() const noexcept ;``

  Returns: A descriptor of the execution resource(s) utilized by this
  execution context to execute work.
  Execution architecture is identified by the ``execution_resource_t`` type.


| ``template< class ... ExecutorProperties >``
|   ``/* exposition only */ detail::executor_t< EC , ExecutorProperties... >``
| ``EC::executor( ExecutorProperties ... p );``

  Returns:
  An executor with ``*this`` execution context and
  execution properties ``p`` when the execution context
  supports these properties.
  Otherwise ``void``.
  [Note: The *detail::executor_t* is for exposition only denoting the
  expectation that an implementation will use an implementation-defined
  metafunction to determine the type of the returned executor. --end note]

.. code-block:: c++

  static_assert( ! is_same_v< void , decltype( ec.executor( p... ) )
               , "Execution context cannot generate executor for given executor properties." );

..

  Remark:
  A particular execution property may have semantic and interface implications,
  such as whether application of the exector returns a future or not
  (sometimes referred to as a two-way or one-way property).
  A particular execution property may only be a performance hint.


``void EC::wait();``

  Requires:
  Cannot be called from non-blocking work submitted to this execution context.
  [Note: Work waiting upon itself guarantees deadlock. --end note]

  Effects:
  Waits until the number of incomplete, non-blocking callables submitted
  to the execution context is observed to be zero.
  [Note: The execution agent from which the wait function is called should
  *boost block* execution agents in the execution context. --end note]


| ``template< class Clock , class Duration >``
| ``bool EC::wait_until( chrono::time_point<Clock,Duration> const & dt );``
| ``template< class Rep , class Period >``
| ``bool EC::wait_for( chrono::duration<Rep,Period> const & dt );``

  Requires:
  Cannot be called from non-blocking work submitted to this execution context.
  [Note: Work waiting upon itself can never return true. --end note]

  Returns:
  ``true`` if the number of incomplete callables is observed zero
  at any point during the call to wait.

  Effects:
  Waits at least ``dt`` for the number of incomplete, non-blocking
  callables submitted to the execution context is observed to be zero.
  [Note: The execution agent from which the wait function is called should
  *boost block* execution agents in the execution context, but may
  only poll to honor the time out.  --end note]


``EC::~EC();``

  Effects:
  Behavior during destruction is denoted by the values of the queried
  execution context properties.

    - If ``EC::query(reject_on_destruction)`` returns true
      then submission of any new work to ``*this`` is rejected.
    - If ``EC::query(abandon_on_destruction)`` returns true
      then work that has been submitted to ``*this``
      but has not yet started executing is abandoned and
      submission of any new work to ``*this`` is rejected.
    - If ``EC::query(wait_on_destruction)`` returns true
      then ``*this`` destructor blocks until work that is executing,
      not rejected, or not abandoned has completed.
    - If ``EC::query(abort_on_destruction)`` returns true
      then ``*this`` attempts to abort work that is executing,
      abandons work that has not yet started executing,
      rejects submission of any new work, and does not block.
      It may not be feasible to abort executing work; however,
      such work will cease to have a defined execution context.

  Remark:
  For example, if
  ``EC::query(reject_on_destruction)``,
  ``!EC::query(abandon_on_destruction)``, and
  ``EC::query(wait_on_destruction)`` then
  submission of new work is rejected and the destructor blocks
  until all executing and previously submitted work completes.


| ``bool operator == ( EC const & lhs , EC const & rhs );``
| ``bool operator != ( EC const & lhs , EC const & rhs );``

  Effects:
  Return whether ``lhs`` and ``rhs`` refer (or not)
  to the same execution context: submitting work to
  ``lhs`` has identical effect as submitting work to ``rhs``.
  


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Execution Resource (see also P0761, Executors Design Document)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An *execution resource* is an descriptor for an implementation defined
hardware and/or software facility capable of executing a
callable function object.
Different resources may offer a broad array of functionality
and semantics and exhibit different performance characteristics
of interest to the performance-conscious programmer.
For example, an implementation might expose different processor cores,
with potentially non-uniform access to memory, as separate resources
to enable programmers to reason about locality.

An execution resource can range from SIMD vector units accessible
in a single thread to an entire runtime managing a large collection of threads.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thread Execution Resource
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
A *thread of execution* executes on a *processing unit* (PU) within an
*execution resource*.
*Threads of execution* can make *concurrent forward progress*
only if they execute on different processing units.
Conversely, a single processing unit cannot
cause two or more *threads of execution* to make concurrent forward progress.
A *thread execution resource* is associated with a
specific set of processing units within the system hardware.

  [Note:
  A *CPU hyperthread* is a common example of 
  a processing unit.
  In a Linux runtime a *thread execution resource* is defined by
  a ``cpu_set_t`` object and is queried through the
  ``sched_getaffinity`` function.
  --end note]

A *processing unit* or *thread execution resource* may be what
was intended by the undefined term "thread contexts" in 33.3.2.6,
"thread static members."

A *thread execution resource* may have *locality partitions*
for its associated set of processing units.
For example, hyperthreads sharing the same CPU core are more local
to one another than to a hyperthreads on different core.

.. code-block:: c++

  struct thread_execution_resource_t {

    thread_execution_resource_t() = delete ;
    thread_execution_resource_t( thread_execution_resource_t && ) = delete ;
    thread_execution_resource_t( thread_execution_resource_t const & ) = delete ;
    thread_execution_resource_t & operator=( thread_execution_resource_t && ) = delete ;
    thread_execution_resource_t & operator=( thread_execution_resource_t const & ) = delete ;

    size_t concurrency() const noexcept ;

    size_t partition_size() const noexcept ;
    
    const thread_execution_resource_t & partition( size_t i ) const noexcept ;

    const thread_execution_resource_t & member_of() const noexcept ;
  };

  extern thread_execution_resource_t program_thread_execution_resource ;

..

``size_t concurrency();``

  Returns:
  This execution resource's potential for concurrent forward progress;
  *i.e.*, the number of processing units
  associated with this execution resource.

  Remark: Has similar intent as 33.2.2.6
  ``std::thread::hardware_concurrency();`` which returns
  "The number of hardware thread contexts."

``size_t partition_size() const noexcept ;``

  Returns:
  Number of locality partitionings of the execution resource.
  
``const thread_execution_resource_t & partition(size_t i) const noexcept ;``

  Requires: ``i < partition_size()``.

  Returns:
  A locality partition of the execution resource.
  Locality partitions are associated disjoint subsets of the
  thread execution resource's processing units.

.. code-block:: c++

  void verify_concurrency( thread_execution_resource_t const & E )
  {
    size_t sum = 0 ;
    for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < E.partition_size() ; ++i )
      sum += E.partition(i).concurrency();
    assert( E.partition_size() == 0 || E.concurrency() == sum );
  }

..

  Remark:
  Processing units residing in the same locality partition
  are *more local* with respect to the memory system
  than processing units in disjoint partitions.
  For example, non-uniform memory access (NUMA) partitions.

``const thread_execution_resource_t & member_of() const noexcept ;``

  Returns:
  If thread execution resource ``M`` is a member of a
  thread execution resource ``E`` partitioning then returns ``E``,
  ``M == E.partition(i)`` for some ``i`` then ``E == M.member_of()``.
  Otherwise returns ``M``.


``extern thread_execution_resource_t program_thread_execution_resource ;``

  Thread execution resource in which the program is *permitted*
  to execute threads. 
  When a program executes it is common for the system runtime to restrict
  that program to execute on a subset of all possible processing units
  of the system hardware.

    [Note:
    For example, the linux ``taskset`` command can restrict a program to
    a specified set of processing units.  The program can use
    ``sched_getaffinity(0,...)`` to query that restriction.
    The proposed ``program_thread_execution_resource``
    is intended to provide the same information.
    --end note]

  Requires:
  ``program_thread_execution_resource.member_of() ==
  program_thread_execution_resource`` and all ``member_of()``
  recursions terminate with ``program_thread_execution_resource``.

  Remark:
  A high-quality implementation will provide a hierarchical
  locality partitioning that terminates when members have
  ``concurrency() == 1``.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Thread Execution Resource
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add to **33.3.3 Namespace this_thread**

.. code-block:: c++

  namespace std::this_thread {

    const thread_execution_resource_t & get_resource();

  }

..


``const thread_execution_resource_t & this_thread::get_resource()``

  Returns:
  An execution resource on which this thread was executing during the
  call to ``get_resource``.

  Remark:
  A thread may migrate between thread execution resources.
  As such the ``get_resource`` returns one of those resources on
  which the thread was executing during the call to ``get_resource``.
  There is no guarantee that this thread is executing on the
  returned thread execution resource before or after the
  call to ``get_resource``.
  A high-quality implementation will return an execution resource
  with ``concurrency() == 1``.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Motivation for Standard Async Execution Context and Executor
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Require that the **33.6.9 Function template async** 
have an equivalent execution context and executor based
mechanism for launching asynchronous work.
This exposes the currently hidden execution context and executor(s)
which the underlying runtime has implemented to enable ``std::async``.

.. code-block:: c++

  // Equivalent without- and with-executor async statements without launch policy

  auto f = std::async( []{ std::cout << "anonymous way\n"} );
  auto f = std::async( std::async_execution_context.executor() , []{ std::cout << "executor way\n"} );

  // Equivalent without- and with-executor async statements with launch policy

  auto f = std::async( std::launch::deferred , []{ std::cout << "anonymous way\n"} );
  auto f = std::async( std::async_execution_context.executor( std::launch::deferred ) , []{ std::cout << "executor way\n"} );

..


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wording for Standard Async Execution Context and Executor
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: c++

  namespace std {

  struct async_execution_context_t {
    // conforming to ExecutionContext concept

    // Execution resource
    using execution_resource_t = thread_execution_resource_t ;

    template< class ... ExecutorProperties >
      /* exposition only */ detail::executor_t< async_execution_context_t , ExecutorProperties... >
    executor( ExecutorProperties ... p );``
  };

  class async_executor_t ; // implementation defined

  extern async_execution_context_t async_execution_context ;

  template< class Function , class ... Args >
  future<std::result_of<std::decay_t<Function>(std::decay_t<Args>...)>>
  async( async_executor_t exec , Function && f , Args && ... args );

  }

..

``extern async_execution_context_t async_execution_context;``

  Global execution context object enabling the
  equivalent invocation of callables 
  through the with-executor ``std::async``
  and without-executor ``std::async``.
  Guaranteed to be initialized during or before the first use.
  [Note: It is likely that
  ``async_execution_context == program_thread_execution_context``.
  --end note]


| ``template< class ... ExecutorProperties >``
|   ``/* exposition only */ detail::executor_t< async_execution_context_t , ExecutorProperties... >``
| ``async_execution_context_t::executor( ExecutorProperties ... p );``

  Returns:
  An *executor* with ``*this`` *execution context* and
  execution properties ``p``.
  If ``p`` is empty, is ``std::launch::async``, or is ``std::launch::deferred``
  the *executor* type is ``async_executor_t``.

| ``template< class Function , class ... Args >``
| ``future<std::result_of<std::decay_t<Function>(std::decay_t<Args>...)>>``
| ``async( async_executor_t exec , Function && f , Args && ... args );``

  Effects:
  If ``exec`` has a ``std::launch`` *policy*
  then equivalent to invoking ``std::async(`` *policy* ``, f , args... );``
  otherwise equivalent to invoking ``std::async( f , args... );``
  Equivalency is symmetric with respect to the non-executor ``std::async``
  functions.

..  _`potential additions` :

Straw polls requested for each of the following potential additions.

  - Strongly-favor = I must have this in next revision of this paper.
  - Weakly-favor = I'd like to see this in a future paper, or perhaps the next revision.
  - Neutral = *whatever*
  - Weakly-against = I don't want to see this in the next revision of this paper, but I am willing to look at it in a future paper.
  - Strongly-against = I never want to see this in any paper.



  #. Add to `thread_execution_resource_t` a hardware architecture trait;
     e.g., the **hwloc** trait for *socket*, *numa*, and *core*.

  #. A mechanism to bind the execution of a ``std::thread`` to
     a specified ``thread_execution_resource``.
     Note that by definition all ``std::thread`` are bound to
     ``program_thread_execution_resource``.

  #. A mechanism to accumulate and query exceptions thrown by
     callables that were submitted by a one-way executor.

  #. A mechanism to provide a callable that is invoked to consume
     exceptions thrown by callables that were submitted by a one-way executor.

  #. A mechanism for preventing further submissions.
     Related to "closed" in Concurrent Queue paper P0260.

  #. A mechanism for cancelling submitted callables that have not been invoked.
     Similar intent as Networking TS ``system_executor::stop()``.
     Note that an execution resource and associated execution context
     may not be able to cancel submitted work; e.g., submitted to a
     hardware queue or to a remote dispatch-and-forget queue.

  #. A mechanism for aborting callables that are executing.
     *Included for completeness, the authors are strongly-against.*

  #. A preferred-locality (affinity) memory space allocator

  #. Proposal to revise Networking TS execution context to align with
     parallelism and concurrency execution context.

  #. Current `thread_execution_resource_t` assumes static set of
     processing units with static hierarchical partitioning topology.
     A process' set of processing units and associated topology could be
     dynamic such that an executing process could adapt to changes;
     e.g., cores could dynamically go off-line and previously off-line
     cores could come back on-line.
     A dynamic set of processing units and dynamic hierarchical
     partitioning topology would require a complete redesign to address
     race conditions between querying and changing the execution resource.
     *Authors need to see a performant runtime that handles such dynamicity
     before considering such a change.*
